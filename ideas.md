## Idea 1: Cyber-Industrial Brutalism

**Design Movement**: Brutalism meets Cyberpunk Industrialism. Think "The Sprawl" or heavy machinery interfaces.

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Function over Form**: Raw, unpolished aesthetic. Visible grids, technical markings.
2.  **Heavy Weight**: Elements feel substantial, like physical switches and heavy metal plates.
3.  **High Contrast & Warning**: Use of hazard stripes, warning colors, and stark contrasts.
4.  **Data Density**: Information is packed, resembling a complex control panel for heavy machinery.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Base**: Deep charcoal, slate grey, and matte black (`#1a1a1a`, `#2d2d2d`).
*   **Accent**: Safety orange (`#ff6600`), industrial yellow (`#ffcc00`), and laser red (`#ff0033`).
*   **Intent**: Evoke the feeling of operating dangerous, high-power defensive weaponry in a gritty, war-torn future.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Modular Grid**: Strict, visible grid lines separating UI sections.
*   **Panel-Based**: distinct "control panels" for different functions (build, upgrade, stats).
*   **Asymmetric Balance**: Heavy controls on one side, tactical map on the other, not perfectly centered.

**Signature Elements**:
*   **Hazard Stripes**: Diagonal yellow/black stripes on critical buttons or danger zones.
*   **Monospaced Data**: All numbers and stats in a raw, terminal-like monospace font.
*   **Rivets and Seams**: Visual borders that look like bolted metal plates.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons have deep "press" states. Sounds are mechanical clunks and hums.
*   **Deliberate Action**: Interactions feel heavy; no instant "sliding", more "snapping" into place.

**Animation**:
*   **Mechanical Transitions**: Panels slide open like heavy doors.
*   **Glitch & Static**: Slight interference effects when taking damage or changing views.
*   **Stutter**: Text types out rapidly like a teletype.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: *Chakra Petch* or *Teko* (Boxy, angular, industrial).
*   **Body/Data**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Share Tech Mono* (Legible, technical).

## Idea 2: Ethereal Glassmorphism / Holographic HUD

**Design Movement**: Aero-Futurism / Glassmorphism. Think "Minority Report" or "Iron Man's HUD".

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Transparency & Depth**: UI elements are floating layers of glass/light over the game world.
2.  **Light as Structure**: Borders and dividers are made of glowing light, not solid lines.
3.  **Fluidity**: Everything is smooth, curved, and frictionless.
4.  **Focus**: The UI recedes when not in use; content (the battlefield) is king.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Base**: Deep space blue/black (`#050510`) but mostly transparent backgrounds with blur (`backdrop-filter`).
*   **Accent**: Cyan (`#00f0ff`), Electric Blue (`#00aaff`), and White (`#ffffff`).
*   **Intent**: Create a sense of advanced, clean, precision technology. The user is a commander in a pristine orbital station.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Floating Islands**: UI elements are detached from screen edges, floating in space.
*   **Radial Menus**: Contextual actions appear around the selected unit/tile.
*   **HUD Overlay**: Stats and info are projected directly onto the game view, not in a side panel.

**Signature Elements**:
*   **Frosted Glass**: Backgrounds have a heavy blur and slight transparency.
*   **Glowing Edges**: Active elements have a soft outer glow.
*   **Thin Lines**: Ultra-thin, precise 1px lines for diagrams and connectors.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Hover-Triggered**: Elements light up or expand as the cursor approaches.
*   **Fluid Gestures**: Drag-and-drop feels like moving light with your finger.

**Animation**:
*   **Fade & Scale**: Windows scale up from zero and fade in.
*   **Pulse**: Critical alerts pulse gently.
*   **Flow**: Energy flows along connection lines.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: *Orbitron* or *Rajdhani* (Wide, futuristic, geometric).
*   **Body**: *Exo 2* or *Barlow* (Clean, readable, modern sans-serif).

## Idea 3: Retro-Synthwave Arcade

**Design Movement**: 80s Retro-Futurism / Synthwave. Think "Tron" or "Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon".

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Neon Everything**: High saturation, glowing lines against pitch black.
2.  **Grid Obsession**: The "perspective grid" is a key visual motif.
3.  **Digital Distortion**: Scanlines, chromatic aberration, and CRT effects.
4.  **Arcade Energy**: High score counters, flashing "INSERT COIN" vibes, bold outlines.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Base**: Void Black (`#000000`) or deep purple (`#1a0b2e`).
*   **Accent**: Hot Pink (`#ff00ff`), Neon Green (`#39ff14`), Cyber Yellow (`#fsh000`).
*   **Intent**: Pure adrenaline and nostalgia. A simulation within a simulation.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Frame-within-Frame**: The game screen looks like a CRT monitor with a bezel.
*   **Top-Heavy HUD**: Score and wave counters big and bold at the top.
*   **Pixel-Perfect Alignment**: Elements snap to a coarse pixel grid.

**Signature Elements**:
*   **Scanlines**: Subtle horizontal lines overlaying the UI.
*   **Wireframes**: Towers and enemies appear as wireframe vectors before solidifying.
*   **Sunsets**: That classic retro sun gradient in backgrounds.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Instant Response**: No lag, instant clicks.
*   **Flashy Feedback**: Every click results in a particle burst or flash.

**Animation**:
*   **Scanline Sweep**: Menus refresh from top to bottom.
*   **Glitch Transitions**: Scenes cut with a digital distortion effect.
*   **Blink**: Text and cursors blink aggressively.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: *Press Start 2P* or *Monoton* (Pixelated or decorative retro).
*   **Body**: *VT323* or *Space Mono* (Terminal style).
